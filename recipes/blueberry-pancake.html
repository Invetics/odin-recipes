    <h3 class="subtitle">Step by Step!</h3>

    <ol class="list">    
        <li>First take the butter and slap it on
            the pan and let it melt for probably a while
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl combine the flower with an egg
            and some milk. You may wish to add sweeteners but
            personally I hate sweet stuff.
        </li>
        <li>After everything is mixed and the butter
            is melted, add the mixture into the pan and let it
            cook!
        </li>
        <li>Before the pancakes finish throw in some
            blueberries and let the pancakes finish.
            You <strong>do not</strong> want the pancakes
            to turn blue.
        </li>
        <li>Set the pancakes on a plate and make them
            look cool and enjoy!
