    <p>
        Today we are going to be cooking the grandest cake you
        have ever eaten before. Remember Mom <em>trying</em>
        to make that chocolate Cake for your birthday? Yeah,
        we all know how that one ended up (sorry mom). Today,
        though, we will be righting the wrong by creating the
        best chocolate cake known to man.

        In order to make this cake properly you will need
        certain ingredients, and a lot of love. We <strong>
        cannot</strong> stress how <em>important</em> it is
        that love is your number 1 ingredient today. If you 
        are sitting here and find yourself with a lot of love
        today, then let's make ourselves the best chocolate Cake
        ever!
