    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Have you ever wanted to munch on the juiciest hamburger
        ever? Well then do I have a treat for you! Today we will be
        sampling a never-before seen hamburger recipe that you can
        and <em><strong>SHOULD</strong></em> use every night and at every
        cookout you go to!</p>

    <p>Despite popular rumors declaring that hamburgers are unethical
        and should not be eaten by startup food chain "Chik-fil-a"
        there is nothing wrong with a yummy hamburger. If you've
        read this far I am quite confident to say that you
        are either a spy for the <em>Lord's Chicken</em> or you 
        just like me and want the best hamburger the world
        can offer you! Lets talk about those ingredients first!</p>

        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>    
        <li>Take your buns out and fry them on the grill
            until they are crispy on low heat. This is so your grill
            has time to ramp up in heat properly (professional griller
            here)
        </li>
        <li>Next take your cheese and lay it on your burger
            and set the burger on the grill. While they are cooking 
            move on to the next step.
        </li>
        <li>Take all three condiments and the Pickles
            and onions. combine the condiments as you see fit
            and then add the pickles and onions to the mix and mash
            until it is a nice and smooth liquid.
        </li>
        <li>Go back to your burger and take it off the grill
            and gather all remaining ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Start with a bun on the bottom and add the special
            mixture of condiments + pickles and onions.
            After that place your burger with cheese on top
            and lay the lettuce and tomato on top. Once
            you put your finals toppings on place the top bun on
            and you are finished!
